# PAWM-ViLabs
This repo is made for project assignment of II3140 - Web and Mobile Application Development. Where students are assigned to create a virtual lab to assist in college studies.

# How to run?
This is a legacy repository that uses only Django with vanilla HTML, CSS, JS. For the upgraded version with full-fledged frontend and backend, check out this repository: [ViLabs2.0](https://github.com/RunningPie/PAWM-ViLabs-Tugas2)

1. You can just clone this repository into a virtual environment (venv).
2. Make sure to have django (version 5.1.2 or above) installed into the venv.
3. Then you can just type in `py manage.py runserver` inside the ViLabs project folder.
4. Voila! You can now access the project locally on 127.0.0.1:8000
